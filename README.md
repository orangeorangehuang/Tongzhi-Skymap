# Tongzhi Skymap
The interactive skymap of the Outline of Astronomy from Tongzhi.

It is live at https://tongzhi-skymap-new.vercel.app/.

It is built with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library, which combines powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. To visualize geographic data, it uses the d3.js package [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) and its extension [d3-geo-projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection).
